## 📁 Files Included

| File Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `task5_capture_yourname.pcapng` | Wireshark capture file containing network packets |
| `report.md` | Detailed report summarizing protocols observed and analysis |
| `1_all_traffic.png` | General capture showing all observed network traffic |
| `2_dns_filter.png` | View of DNS packets filtered using `dns` |
| `3_tcp_filter.png` | View of TCP packets filtered using `tcp` |
| `4_packet_details.png` | Expanded view of a single packet (headers + hex view) |

## 🔍 Protocols Analyzed

### 🔹 DNS
- Used for domain name resolution (e.g., resolving google.com)

### 🔹 TCP
- Ensures reliable delivery using 3-way handshake (SYN, ACK)

### 🔹 TLSv1.3
- Encrypted communication over HTTPS

## 📝 Summary

Wireshark was used to capture and analyze real-time network traffic on Kali Linux. Several protocols were identified and filtered. Screenshots and a `.pcapng` file were collected to demonstrate understanding of packet structure, filtering, and analysis.
